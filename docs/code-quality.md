## üì¶ Database Design

:::tip Best Practices
Follow these guidelines to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable database designs.
:::

### Core Principles

- **Use UUIDs** instead of auto-increment primary keys
- **Normalize tables** to reduce redundancy and improve consistency
- **Add indexes** to frequently queried fields
- **Use composite indexes** for multi-column queries (compound indexing)
- **Use constraints** (foreign key, uniqueness, check) to enforce data integrity
- **Archive or purge** stale data periodically
- **Avoid N+1 queries** by using eager/lazy loading appropriately

### Migration & Documentation

- Use **database migrations** with meaningful names and version control
- **Document schema decisions** and rationale
- Plan for **DB sharding strategies** (e.g., range/hash based on UUID)
- Evaluate **column types** for nullability and data purpose

### Performance & Security

- **List and track all DB I/O calls** to monitor performance and exposure of PII
- Consider **read replicas** for scaling and analytics
- Implement **row-level security (RLS)** where applicable

---

## üåê API Design & Backend Architecture

:::info Architecture Focus
Design APIs that are scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly.
:::

### API Structure

- Use **async APIs** for performance in I/O-heavy operations
- Structure **API URLs with versioning** (`/api/v1/resource/`)
- Enforce **input/output contracts** (e.g., Pydantic, Marshmallow)
- Use **OpenAPI/Swagger** for auto-generated documentation
- Return **consistent error responses** with structured payloads

### Features & Functionality

- Implement **pagination, filtering, and sorting** in API responses
- Use **class-based views** or route handlers to reduce code repetition
- **Separate business logic** from controllers/routes using service layers and DAL
- Implement **rate limiting, API key authentication, and access control**
- Avoid **tight coupling** with API frameworks (keep core logic independent)

### Reliability

- Use **idempotency keys** for safe retry operations
- Plan for **schema evolution**: avoid removing fields; use optional/nullables

---

## üß± Code Quality & Structure

:::warning Code Standards
Maintain high code quality standards to ensure long-term maintainability.
:::

### Design Principles

- Apply **SOLID principles** and design patterns (Factory, Strategy, etc.)
- Use **consistent naming conventions** (snake_case, camelCase as per language)
- Avoid **deep nesting and long functions** ‚Äî keep code modular
- Replace **hardcoded strings** with constants/enums
- Group **related logic** into reusable utilities or helpers

### Code Hygiene

- Keep code **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Remove **dead code**, unused functions, variables, and imports
- Use **feature flags** for experimental features
- Write **platform-agnostic** and dependency-light code
- Use **linting, formatting tools** (e.g., Black, Prettier, ESLint)

### Production Readiness

- Avoid **print statements** in production ‚Äî use structured logging
- Ensure **code readability** for future maintainers and AI agents
- **Tag and redact PII info** in logs, APIs, and UI responses
- Use **dependency injection** for testability
- **Organize by domain** or bounded context (DDD-lite)

---

## üß™ Testing & Code Review

:::note Testing Strategy
Implement comprehensive testing strategies to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
:::

### Testing Types

- Write **unit, integration, and functional tests**
- Use **mocks, fixtures, and factories** to isolate test logic
- Maintain **>80% meaningful test coverage**
- Automate tests with **CI tools** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

### Quality Gates

- Use **code quality gates** (lint, test pass, size limit) before merging PRs
- Require **peer review and approvals** before merging
- Document **edge cases and complex logic** in PR descriptions
- Use **pre-commit hooks** to catch issues early

### Advanced Testing

- Track **associated Jira tickets** with commits and PRs
- Consider **mutation or property-based testing** for critical code

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Environment Management

:::caution Security First
Handle configuration and secrets with security as the top priority.
:::

### Configuration Management

- Load **sensitive configs via environment variables**
- Keep **`.env` files per environment** (dev/staging/prod)
- Use **YAML or JSON** for structured app configs
- **Encrypt secrets** in transit and at rest (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)

### Validation & Features

- **Validate config at app startup** (fail fast if invalid)
- Support **dual Git remotes** (e.g., production and open-source forks)
- Use **feature flag services** (LaunchDarkly, Unleash)

---

## üìä Observability & Logging

:::info Monitoring Excellence
Implement comprehensive observability to understand system behavior and performance.
:::

### Logging Strategy

- Implement **structured logging with context** (request ID, user ID)
- Separate **log levels** (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
- **Centralize logs** using aggregators (e.g., ELK, Loki)

### Metrics & Monitoring

- Use **Prometheus for metrics** and **Grafana for dashboards**
- Integrate **Sentry, New Relic** for APM and error tracking
- **Alert on high-latency APIs**, error spikes, DB bottlenecks
- Review all **I/O-heavy functions** for necessary logging

### Advanced Observability

- Implement **distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry, Zipkin)
- Avoid **alert fatigue** with suppression and grouping strategies

---

## üîí Security & Compliance

:::danger Security Critical
Security should be built into every layer of the application.
:::

### Web Security

- Set **`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`** on cookies
- Use **HTTPS everywhere**; terminate SSL at a load balancer
- **Sanitize all user input** to prevent XSS, SQLi, CSRF
- Set **CORS policy** deliberately

### Dependency & Access Management

- Keep **dependencies updated** and remove unused packages
- **Rotate secrets and credentials** periodically
- Log **access and modification** to sensitive resources
- Enforce **least privilege** in code and infrastructure

### Security Practices

- **Audit code regularly**; conduct pen tests
- **Redact PII** in logs and responses
- Use **static analysis tools** (Semgrep, SonarQube)
- Enable **automated dependency scanning** (e.g., Snyk)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience & Tooling

:::tip Developer Productivity
Optimize the developer experience to increase productivity and reduce friction.
:::

### Setup & Onboarding

- Use **pre-configured boilerplates** for fast starts
- **Automate setup** with Makefiles or scripts
- Provide **CLI tools** for internal tasks (e.g., data seeding)
- Use **plug-and-play modular architecture**

### Documentation & Workflow

- **Prefer open-source tools**; fork only if needed
- **Document workflows** (setup, testing, deployment)
- Build **internal tools** to reduce recurring manual work
- Offer **onboarding materials** (README, architecture diagrams)

### Development Environment

- Support **hot reload** in dev environments
- Define **mono vs. polyrepo strategy** and document why

---

## üöÄ Scalability & Performance

:::success Performance Focus
Design systems that can scale horizontally and handle increasing loads efficiently.
:::

### Caching & Async Processing

- **Cache frequently accessed data** (e.g., Redis, CDN)
- Use **async job queues** for long-running tasks (Celery, Sidekiq)
- **Load test services** for expected scale
- Design for **horizontal scaling** (stateless services)

### Resource Management

- Use **connection pooling** for DBs and third-party services
- Implement **graceful degradation and circuit breakers**
- Prefer **contracts/interfaces** over tight coupling
- Avoid **I/O in loops** ‚Äî batch or async where possible

### System Design

- Use **multi-threading vs. multi-processing** based on workload
- Use **backpressure mechanisms** to protect systems
- Design services **cloud-natively** (e.g., containers, Kubernetes)

---

## ‚ùó Error Handling & Libraries

:::warning Error Management
Implement robust error handling to improve system reliability and debugging.
:::

### Error Handling Strategy

- Use **centralized custom error class hierarchy** (with codes)
- **Open source error-handling logic** if broadly applicable
- Remove **unused libraries** and tighten `requirements.txt`
- Raise **structured exceptions** with full context

### Error Recovery

- **Fail fast** on unrecoverable logic
- **Tag errors by severity and source**
- Define **retry strategies** (e.g., exponential backoff with jitter)
