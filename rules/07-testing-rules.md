# Testing Rules

## Overview
Essential rules for implementing comprehensive testing strategies.

## Rules

### T1: Write Unit Tests for All Functions
- **Rule**: Write unit tests for all functions
- **Category**: Testing
- **Description**: Every function must have corresponding unit tests to verify individual component functionality. Focus on testing pure functions, edge cases, and business logic.

### T2: Implement Integration Tests
- **Rule**: Implement integration tests
- **Category**: Testing
- **Description**: Integration tests must be implemented to verify system component interactions, API endpoints, and data flow between services.

### T3: Test Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- **Rule**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
- **Category**: Testing
- **Description**: All edge cases and potential error scenarios must be covered by tests. Think about boundary conditions, null values, empty inputs, and system limits.

### T4: Verify Test Coverage Meets Requirements
- **Rule**: Verify test coverage meets requirements
- **Category**: Testing
- **Description**: Test coverage must meet or exceed the established project requirements. Use coverage tools to identify untested code paths and aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentages.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Python with pytest and coverage
  pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=85
